# Hackerthon Scenario

A few developers have gotten together during a hackathon and started building a web-based game they call "Fantasy Coinball". The concept for the game is that you'll select a team of semi-fictitious blockchain developers, and adjust your team each turn to try to maximise the value of your coin.

There's no scoring or turn system yet, but they do have the beginnings of something which could work.

They've been told they can spend every Friday working on it and turn it into a proper game - but only if they can come up with a really solid plan for how to build it properly, in a highly maintainable fashion.

Their manager has told them their plan needs to prioritise:

* Quality. This will be a showcase for what the company can do, so it needs to work reliably, and the codebase needs to be clean.
* LEAN. Don't spend time building things if we can just use an external service.
* Automation. There will be no ops team for this project, so they won't have time to waste on manual deployment steps.
* Maintainability. They want interns to be able to work on this during down-time, so inexperienced programmers need to be able to get it up and running and understand the structure.
* Monitoring. It should be easy to get insights into what is going on with the system, and track down errors when they occur.

# Your job

First of all: you don't need to do any actual work on the code (for now). Please don't start hacking code!

Take a look at readme.txt, and then have a look around the project source code. You don't need to get it running if you don't want to - who knows if it will even work on a PC other than the one they've been hacking at it on!

We want a short list of recommendations for the team. They can be focused on code, documentation, automation, deployment strategies, process, or anything else you can think of. The goal of these recommendations is for the team to spend a few days re-factoring the code, adding to it, building automation, selecting tooling, writing documentation, or whatever else is needed to get the project into a better state - to build out the game, and convince their manager that they can meet the above priorities.

The team consists of two front-end developers and two back-end developers, and while they're all fairly inexperienced they are keen to learn and happy to pick up new things. Try to focus on modern technologies which will be worthwhile for junior developers to learn!

# Deliverables

Please email your recommendations back to us - the format is your choice. A HTML presentation, a bunch of powerpoint slides, a markdown file, however you would like to deliver them. If the format is a presentation, please attach speaker notes so we know what you would be saying!

# Time commitment

We appreciate that people are busy. We're not looking for you to spend a lot of time on this, so we're not looking for a professional-quality production. We're more interested in the content - so please don't spend time polishing this.

Ideally it will only take you an hour or two.

# Next steps

We'll take a look at your recommendations, and if we like them we'll ask you to come in for a tech interview (or we can do it online using Google Hangouts). We'll have a laptop ready with the project up and running, and we'll ask you to implement one or two of your recommendations (so make sure you have at least a couple which play to your technical strengths).

Please don't prepare anything - we'll be looking to pair-code it with you, not see something you prepared earlier.
